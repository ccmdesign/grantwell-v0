    <p>Okay, let me check the eligibility requirements for this grant opportunity.</p>
    <p>The search results provide an overview of the eligibility requirements for this grant, including threshold eligibility criteria, application submission information, and review processes. Based on this, it seems that the key things to determine eligibility are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Meeting the threshold eligibility criteria outlined in Section IV.</li>
      <li>Submitting the application through Grants.gov by the deadline.</li>
      <li>Providing all required application components as described in Section IV.B.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To determine if you are eligible, I would recommend reviewing the threshold eligibility criteria and application requirements in detail to ensure you meet all the necessary conditions. Let me know if you have any other specific questions!</p>
